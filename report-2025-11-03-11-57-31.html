Most people with T1D for more than five years have a glitch in the secretion of a hormone called Glucagon. This hormone is like a little helper in our body, releasing stored glucose from the liver when blood sugar drops. When Glucagon isn't working properly, the risk of severe hypoglycaemia increases.

Researchers are now studying whether keeping blood sugar levels well-managed for a period of time can help improve how Glucagon works. They're using the latest technology, automated insulin delivery systems, which continuously monitor blood sugar and adjust insulin delivery accordingly. The study participants will also follow a low carbohydrate diet to help prevent blood sugar spikes after meals. 

This research is still in progress, but it's a big step towards understanding and improving how our bodies respond to low blood sugar. It gives us hope that we're moving closer to better management strategies for T1D and, eventually, a cure.</div><div class="details"><div class="technical-summary"><strong>Technical Details:</strong><br><br>The clinical trial NCT04614168 is an active but not recruiting study that aims to investigate the Glucagon response to hypoglycaemia in patients with Type 1 Diabetes. The focus is on patients who have had T1D for more than five years, a population known to frequently exhibit a defect in Glucagon secretion. 

Glucagon plays a crucial role in the physiological response to hypoglycaemia, releasing glucose stores from the liver to normalize blood glucose levels. A defect in this response increases the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, a common and hazardous complication in T1D.

The study proposes that tight blood glucose control over a period of time may improve the Glucagon response. To achieve this control, the research utilizes Automated Insulin Delivery systems (AIDs), an advanced technology that integrates a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) with an insulin pump. The CGM continuously monitors blood glucose levels, and an algorithm adjusts insulin delivery based on these readings. 

In addition, participants will follow a low carbohydrate diet to mitigate postprandial hyperglycaemia. The Glucagon response to hypoglycaemia is evaluated at zero and eight months using the hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic clamp technique.

The findings from this study could provide significant insight into the pathophysiology of T1D and inform the development of more effective treatment strategies, ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals with T1D.</div><div class="meta-info"><div class="meta-item"><strong>ID:</strong> NCT04614168</div><div class="meta-item"><strong>Status:</strong> ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING</div><div class="meta-item"><strong>Date:</strong> 2021-07-26</div><div class="meta-item"><strong>Source:</strong> ClinicalTrials.gov</div></div><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04614168" target="_blank" class="read-more">View Full Study →</a></div><p class="expand-hint">Click to expand for more</p></div><div class="card" data-type="Clinical Trial" data-promise="1" onclick="this.classList.toggle('expanded')"><div class="promise-badge" style="background: #6b7280;">💡 Progress</div><div class="card-type">Clinical Trial</div><h2 class="card-title">DailyDose Smart Snack Study for T1D on MDI</h2><div class="key-takeaway"><strong>Key Point:</strong> We understand that managing your child's Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) can sometimes be daunting, especially worrying about low glucose levels at night</div><div class="parent-summary">We understand that managing your child's Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) can sometimes be daunting, especially worrying about low glucose levels at night.

It also provides a strong foundation for future studies aimed at refining the HCL system and exploring its potential benefits in different settings and populations.</div><div class="meta-info"><div class="meta-item"><strong>ID:</strong> NCT04878120</div><div class="meta-item"><strong>Status:</strong> COMPLETED</div><div class="meta-item"><strong>Date:</strong> 2021-05-14</div><div class="meta-item"><strong>Source:</strong> ClinicalTrials.gov</div></div><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04878120" target="_blank" class="read-more">View Full Study →</a></div><p class="expand-hint">Click to expand for more</p></div><div class="card" data-type="Clinical Trial" data-promise="1" onclick="this.classList.toggle('expanded')"><div class="promise-badge" style="background: #6b7280;">💡 Progress</div><div class="card-type">Clinical Trial</div><h2 class="card-title">Breaking Disparities in Access to Advanced Diabetes Technologies in Children With Type 1 Diabetes</h2><div class="key-takeaway"><strong>Key Point:</strong> We understand that managing your child's Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) can be challenging</div><div class="parent-summary">We understand that managing your child's Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) can be challenging. We're excited to share with you a new research study that aims to make it easier for children and adolescents with T1D, especially those from less privileged backgrounds, to access and use advanced diabetes technologies. These technologies, like insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), can help keep blood sugar levels in a healthier range. 

This study is recruiting children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years old with T1D who are currently using insulin therapy. The researchers will help these families navigate the insurance approval process for these advanced technologies and provide them with these devices as part of their regular diabetes care. The aim here is to see if using these devices can improve blood sugar control, as well as how comfortable families feel using these technologies. The results could help improve the ways we treat T1D, especially for those who may face more challenges in accessing quality healthcare.</div><div class="details"><div class="technical-summary"><strong>Technical Details:</strong><br><br>The clinical trial, titled "Breaking Disparities in Access to Advanced Diabetes Technologies in Children With Type 1 Diabetes," is currently in the recruiting phase. This study aims to address the health disparities in children and adolescents with T1D from lower socio-economic statuses (SES), specifically those below the 200% poverty line. 

The study plans to recruit 50 participants aged between 6 and 18 years with suboptimal T1D control (HbA1c≥8.0%). The study population will include approximately one-third African American, one-third Hispanic/Latino, and one-third non-Hispanic whites. All qualifying families who consent will transition to closed-loop technologies, and data will be collected before and after the use of these devices. 

Key outcomes will include the time-in-range, HbA1c levels, other glucose metrics, and questionnaire responses related to the use of technology and diabetes-related distress. These outcomes will be analyzed at baseline and compared to the data collected at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. With the potential for rapid application in the field, these results may inform decisions made by payers, clinicians, and patients, ultimately targeting to reduce healthcare disparities in this population.</div><div class="meta-info"><div class="meta-item"><strong>ID:</strong> NCT05849753</div><div class="meta-item"><strong>Status:</strong> RECRUITING</div><div class="meta-item"><strong>Date:</strong> 2023-07-26</div><div class="meta-item"><strong>Source:</strong> ClinicalTrials.gov</div></div><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05849753" target="_blank" class="read-more">View Full Study →</a></div><p class="expand-hint">Click to expand for more</p></div><div class="card" data-type="Clinical Trial" data-promise="1" onclick="this.classList.toggle('expanded')"><div class="promise-badge" style="background: #6b7280;">💡 Progress</div><div class="card-type">Clinical Trial</div><h2 class="card-title">Islet Transplantation Using PKX-001</h2><div class="key-takeaway"><strong>Key Point:</strong> Great news for families affected by Type 1 Diabetes</div><div class="parent-summary">Great news for families affected by Type 1 Diabetes! A clinical trial has been studying a new approach to help those with difficult to control Type 1 Diabetes. This method is called Islet Transplantation. In simple terms, insulin-producing cells, known as islets, are taken from a deceased donor's pancreas and transplanted into the liver of the person with diabetes. These transplanted cells have the potential to produce insulin, which could improve the patient's condition significantly.

However, there have been challenges with this process. Some of the transplanted cells tend to die due to inflammation and other factors. That's why researchers have introduced a new medication called PKX-001. This drug, inspired by natural antifreeze proteins found in Arctic and Antarctic fish, has been shown to help these islet cells survive better and function well. The trial has shown promising results in animals, where the cells treated with PKX-001 not only survived but also continued to function well. 

This study has been completed with up to 10 participants from the islet transplant waiting list, and the results are looking positive. This could be a significant advancement in the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes, offering hope for better management of the condition and potentially a step towards a cure.</div><div class="details"><div class="technical-summary"><strong>Technical Details:</strong><br><br>A phase one clinical trial, identified as NCT03073577, has been conducted to explore the effectiveness of PKX-001 in islet transplantation for patients with difficult to control Type 1 Diabetes. Islet transplantation involves the isolation of insulin-producing cells (islets) from a deceased donor pancreas, which are then transplanted into the recipient's liver. However, this process has been complicated by the death of some transplanted islets due to inflammation, oxidative stress, and exposure to diabetogenic immunosuppressive agents.

The trial has tested the use of antiaging glycopeptide (PKX-001), a synthetic analog of antifreeze proteins (AFPs) naturally present in Arctic and Antarctic fish. In vitro studies have shown that PKX-001 can aid in the survival of isolated islet cells, maintaining their health and function. In vivo studies have demonstrated that islets treated with PKX-001 were protected from tacrolimus (Tac) toxicity, a common immunosuppressant used in transplant procedures.

The study involved up to 10 participants from the Clinical Islet Transplant Program's waiting list, all of whom received islets treated with PKX-001. The trial aimed to confirm the safety of transplantation with PKX-001 treated islets and to evaluate the cytoprotective capacity of PKX-001 in islet transplantation, particularly its ability to protect against Tac-induced graft dysfunction. With the status of the trial being completed, this signifies a potential breakthrough in mitigating the challenges associated with islet transplantation in Type 1 Diabetes treatment.</div><div class="meta-info"><div class="meta-item"><strong>ID:</strong> NCT03073577</div><div class="meta-item"><strong>Status:</strong> COMPLETED</div><div class="meta-item"><strong>Date:</strong> 2017-02-17</div><div class="meta-item"><strong>Source:</strong> ClinicalTrials.gov</div></div><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03073577" target="_blank" class="read-more">View Full Study →</a></div><p class="expand-hint">Click to expand for more</p></div><div class="card" data-type="Clinical Trial" data-promise="1" onclick="this.classList.toggle('expanded')"><div class="promise-badge" style="background: #6b7280;">💡 Progress</div><div class="card-type">Clinical Trial</div><h2 class="card-title">Mortality and Cardiovascular Diseases in Adult-onset Type 1 Diabetes</h2><div class="key-takeaway"><strong>Key Point:</strong> There's some exciting news for families dealing with adult-onset Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)</div><div class="parent-summary">There's some exciting news for families dealing with adult-onset Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).

This exciting study is called "Continuous Monitoring of Glycemic Variability to Predict Dys- and Hyperglycemia in Asymptomatic Type 1 Diabetes." In simpler terms, it's looking at how blood sugar levels can change throughout the day in people who may be at risk of developing Type 1 Diabetes, but aren't showing symptoms yet. The researchers are using a user-friendly device that can continuously monitor these changes in real-time.

What does this mean for you and your family? It means that in the future, your doctors might be able to give you an easier and more accurate way to keep an eye on glucose levels, helping to prevent potential health problems before they start.

Participants aged between 5 and 39 years will be tested repeatedly using oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) and hyperglycemic clamp tests for a period of 2-3 years.

The study aims to answer four main research questions: 
1. Does the amplitude and time trends of CGM-derived glycemic variability indices and OGTT- and clamp-derived variables differ between the intermediate, high and very high risk groups?
2. Can (changes in) CGM-derived glycemic variability indices predict/detect dysglycemia in initially normoglycemic (single or multiple autoantibody-positive) individuals with the same diagnostic efficiency as OGTT- or clamp-derived variables?
3. Can (changes in) CGM-derived glycemic variability indices predict clinical onset in (stage 1 or 2) multiple autoantibody-positive individuals with the same diagnostic efficiency as OGTT- or clamp-derived variables?
4. Can correlating (changes in) CGM-derived indices with (changes in) OGTT- and clamp-derived variables help to better understand the sequence of events leading to dysglycemia and clinical onset, as well as the relative contribution of beta cell function and insulin action to glycemic variability according to disease stage and biological and phenotypical characteristics of the individuals?

While the study is still in the recruiting phase, it holds promise for refining the diagnostic process, understanding disease progression, and ultimately improving patient care in T1D.

Two data collection points were established: baseline and a 1-month follow-up. The baseline data included demographic and clinical information, previous month's glycemic control, diabetes management specifics, and details about the participants' regular physical activity. The 1-month follow-up involved downloading data from the insulin pump and glucose sensor, covering a period from 15 days before the first recorded exercise session to 15 days after the last one.

The early identification and treatment of PDN can mitigate these impacts, prevent further complications such as foot ulcers and amputations, and reduce healthcare costs.

The study's aim is to culturally adapt and validate a tool for PDN screening in Thailand, where such instruments are currently lacking. The tool, PainPREDICT, is an internationally validated questionnaire designed to characterize neuropathic pain profiles. However, its applicability and reliability for Thai patients have not been established, hence the need for this study.

In addition to this, this study will explore the potential of mobile health technologies (mHealth) in expanding access to screening and monitoring of chronic conditions, particularly in resource-limited settings. The use of mHealth could revolutionize the management of PDN and other diabetes complications, making it more convenient and accessible for patients and healthcare providers alike.

A new treatment has shown very promising results in initial trials. The treatment involves transplanting specially developed cells, known as CiPSC islets, into a patient. What's special about these cells? They are derived from the patient's own body and then chemically transformed to act like the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, which are missing or not working properly in people with Type 1 Diabetes.

In a recent study, a patient who received this treatment was able to stop regular insulin injections after just 75 days! This is because the transplanted cells started producing insulin in the body, performing the job of the cells that were not working properly. The patient's blood sugar levels also became much more stable, reaching near-normal levels. One year after the treatment, everything still looks great with no indication of any problems related to the transplant. 

This is a hopeful development for families dealing with Type 1 Diabetes, as it could be a major step toward a potential cure. More studies need to be done, but the future certainly looks brighter!</div><div class="details"><div class="technical-summary"><strong>Technical Details:</strong><br><br>In a landmark phase I clinical trial (ChiCTR2300072200), researchers reported on the feasibility of autologous transplantation of chemically induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived islets (CiPSC islets) for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes. This study signifies a paradigm shift in current T1D management strategies, moving from symptomatic management to potential disease reversal.

The CiPSC islets were derived from the patient's own cells, chemically induced to differentiate into insulin-producing cells, and then transplanted beneath the abdominal anterior rectus sheath. This method has the advantage of bypassing the immune rejection usually associated with donor islet transplantation.

The patient in the study achieved insulin independence 75 days post-transplantation. The patient's time-in-target glycemic range increased from 43.18% to 96.21% by the fourth month post-transplantation, and the glycated hemoglobin levels, reflective of long-term systemic glucose levels, decreased to a non-diabetic range. The patient maintained stable glycemic control with time-in-target glycemic range >98% and glycated hemoglobin around 5% for the following year.

The one-year clinical data met all study endpoints, with no evidence of transplant-related abnormalities, demonstrating both the safety and efficacy of the CiPSC islet transplantation. These results warrant further clinical studies on CiPSC-islet transplantation as a potentially curative treatment for Type 1 Diabetes.</div><div class="meta-info"><div class="meta-item"><strong>ID:</strong> 39326417</div><div class="meta-item"><strong>Status:</strong> Published</div><div class="meta-item"><strong>Date:</strong> 2024</div><div class="meta-item"><strong>Source:</strong> PubMed</div></div><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39326417/" target="_blank" class="read-more">View Full Study →</a></div><p class="expand-hint">Click to expand for more</p></div><div class="card" data-type="Research Article" data-promise="2" onclick="this.classList.toggle('expanded')"><div class="promise-badge" style="background: #6b7280;">💡 Progress</div><div class="card-type">Research Article</div><h2 class="card-title">Type 1 diabetes.</h2><div class="key-takeaway"><strong>Key Point:</strong> Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, a hormone necessary...</div><div class="parent-summary">Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, a hormone necessary to regulate our blood sugar levels.

The good news is that they've made some incredible progress over the last ten years, and we're getting closer to understanding how this disease works.

One of the key things they've found out is that T1D seems to be a kind of tug-of-war in the body between two types of cells: the 'regulatory' cells and the 'effector' cells. Generally, if the regulatory cells are winning, the disease is kept in check. If the effector cells get the upper hand, that's when T1D can start causing problems. By understanding this, scientists are hoping it will help them predict who is at risk of getting T1D, when it might start, and how quickly it might progress. 

Even more exciting, based on these findings, researchers are now testing new ways to treat T1D. These new treatments aim to prevent the disease from starting in the first place or even cure it entirely. While it's not a guaranteed solution yet, these findings bring us hope and bring scientists one step closer to finding a cure for T1D.</div><div class="details"><div class="technical-summary"><strong>Technical Details:</strong><br><br>The research article titled "Genetics, pathogenesis and clinical interventions in type 1 diabetes" has made significant advancements in the understanding of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).
